title: A Brand New Website!

I haven't had a portfolio online for quite some time. 4 years to be exact. I am a pretty busy person, and I tend to get a lot of freelance work by word-of-mouth. So I haven't really needed a portfolio until very recently. 

It's about time I put some of the projects I've worked on together in one place. I am looking forward to to start blogging regularly about coding, conferences and meetups that I attend. Also it would be nice to keep a record of some of the Ladies Learning Code events that will be taking place soon.

Looking forward to keep this going!

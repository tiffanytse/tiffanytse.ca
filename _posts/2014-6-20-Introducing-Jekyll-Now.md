title: Introducing Jekyll Now
---

[Jekyll](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs.

[Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) makes it easier to create a Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependancies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it
- In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog just like this one—giving you more time to spend on making your blog awesome!

## Create your blog in 30 seconds!

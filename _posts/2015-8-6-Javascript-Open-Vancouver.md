I recently attended a conference in Vancouver, called JS Open Day. The conference was all about web development, the tools we use to build it, and where the web is going. I got to fly out to Vancouver for a few days, while also getting to present on Style Guides and why you should already be using them. 

I had some pretty amazing meals in Vancouver, and took in a few sights as well. I would love to go back someday and spend more time there. 

You can check out my presentation [here](http://slides.com/tset/styleguides) if you are interested in learning more about Style Guides!

Iâ€™ll be posting soon the recorded presentation I did at DrupalCamp Ottawa on teaching as well. 

Cheers!

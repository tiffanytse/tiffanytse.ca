  <p>My name is Tiffany Tse and I live in Ottawa, Ontario. I work for <a href="http://coldfrontlabs.ca/" rel="external">Coldfront Labs Inc.</a> as the Creative Director where I build Drupal applications and websites. I also work part-time as a Professor at <a href="http://www.algonquincollege.com/" rel="external">Algonquin College</a> in the Graphic Design diploma program. I teach web development, usability and motion graphics.</p>

  <p>In my spare time I enjoy cooking and watching TV. I drink a lot of tea, I like going to maker and web meetups, and love to explore the outdoors. I also really like speaking at conferences, and learning new things.</p>

  <p>I am passionate about inspiring young designers and developers, so I also work as the Ottawa chapter co-lead for Ladies Learning Code. The workshops that I help to organize act as a resource for women and youth and assist them in becoming passionate builders - not just consumers - of technology.  The workshops enable the women and youth to learn technical skills in a hands-on, social, and collaborative way.</p>
